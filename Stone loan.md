# Stone loan

A [[Daask]] form of taking people hostage to ensure loan repayment. Connected to them being [[Loan sharks]].

Where one of the borrower's family members is petrified. Failure to repay the debt by the due date results in a finger or toe being chipped from the statue and sent to the borrower for each missed payment. Unclaimed victims are often brought back to [[Droaam]], where they are auctioned off to the highest bidder to make up for lost revenue.
